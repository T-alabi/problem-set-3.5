    <p> Gymnastics was intorduced by early greek civilizations.The Greek word <i>gymnazein</i> litertally means "to exercise naked."
       A persons level of fitness was very important, thus men and women participated in
     gymnastic exercise. After Greece was conquored by Rome, the Romans advanced gymnastics into a more formal sport.
