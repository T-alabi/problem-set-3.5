    <h3>When It Began</h3>
    <p> Gymnastics was intorduced by early greek civilizations.The Greek word <i>gymnazein</i> litertally means "to exercise naked."
       A persons level of fitness was very important, thus men and women participated in
     gymnastic exercise. After Greece was conquored by Rome, the Romans advanced gymnastics into a more formal sport.
   </p> <br/>
<h3>Modern Gymnastics and Competition</h3>
<p> The modern gymnastics equiptment we know as the parallel bars, the balence beam, and jumoing events
were created in the late 1700s. from there gymnastics flourshied in Germany and the creation of gymnastics
schools lead to the growing popularity of the sport. This eventually lead to the first Modern Olympic
games in 1896 that included Men's gymnastics.</p> <br/>
<p>The first Olympic games to include women's gymnastics was in 1936 with only an all around competition.
in 1952 seperate events were added in addition to the all around compettion. </p>
